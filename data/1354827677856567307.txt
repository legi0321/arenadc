Victory is mine
This ends now
Only one will stand
My power is unmatched
I was born for this
Your defeat is inevitable
Bring your best — it won’t be enough
No mercy no retreat
Let the clash begin
You’ll remember this loss
Too strong to fall
Another win another day
You can’t stop the storm
I rise you fall
Prepare to be humbled
I don’t fight to lose
Time to claim the leaderboard
One step closer to the top
Not luck just skill
